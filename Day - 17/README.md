# 🎄 Advent of Cyber 2025 — Day 17  
## 🧪 CyberChef & Security Data Decoding

Day 17 introduces **CyberChef**, a powerful data analysis tool often referred to as the “Swiss Army knife of cybersecurity”. This challenge focuses on decoding, transforming, and analyzing suspicious data commonly encountered during security investigations.

CyberChef is widely used by SOC analysts and incident responders to quickly analyze unknown or obfuscated data.

---

## 🎯 Objective
- Understand the purpose of CyberChef in security investigations  
- Learn how encoded or transformed data is used by attackers  
- Explore common data transformation techniques  
- Develop practical analysis skills for incident response  

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts Covered

### 🔹 What is CyberChef?
CyberChef is a web-based tool that allows analysts to:
- Decode and encode data  
- Decrypt and encrypt content  
- Parse and transform structured data  
- Analyze suspicious artifacts quickly  

It enables rapid analysis without writing custom scripts.

---

### 🔹 Why Attackers Encode Data
Attackers often encode or obfuscate data to:
- Hide malicious payloads  
- Evade detection  
- Bypass security filters  
- Conceal command-and-control data  

Recognizing encoded data is a key investigative skill.

---

### 🔹 Common Data Transformations
Common transformations analyzed using CyberChef include:
- Base64 encoding/decoding  
- URL encoding  
- Hexadecimal encoding  
- Data compression  

Multiple layers of encoding may be applied to increase complexity.

---

### 🔹 CyberChef in Incident Response
CyberChef is frequently used during:
- Malware analysis  
- Log analysis  
- Phishing investigations  
- Network traffic inspection  

It helps analysts quickly uncover the true meaning of suspicious data.
