# 🎄 Advent of Cyber 2025 — Day 06  
## 🦠 Malware Fundamentals & Threat Awareness

Day 06 introduces **malware fundamentals**, focusing on what malware is, how it behaves, and why it poses a serious threat to systems and organizations.

Rather than deep reverse engineering, this challenge emphasizes **recognition, impact, and defensive awareness**, which are essential skills for SOC and blue-team roles.

---

## 🎯 Objective
- Understand what malware is and why it is dangerous  
- Learn common types of malware and their behavior  
- Identify how malware enters systems  
- Develop a defensive mindset for detecting malware activity  

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts Covered

### 🔹 What Is Malware?
Malware (malicious software) is designed to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access to systems and data.

Malware is often used to:
- Steal sensitive information  
- Disrupt operations  
- Gain persistent access to systems  
- Spread to other machines  

---

### 🔹 Common Types of Malware
- **Viruses** – Attach to legitimate files and spread when executed  
- **Worms** – Self-propagate across networks without user interaction  
- **Trojans** – Disguised as legitimate software  
- **Ransomware** – Encrypts data and demands payment  
- **Spyware** – Monitors user activity and collects information  

Each type behaves differently but shares the goal of compromising systems.

---

### 🔹 Malware Infection Vectors
Malware commonly enters systems through:
- Phishing emails and malicious attachments  
- Infected downloads  
- Compromised websites  
- Exploiting unpatched vulnerabilities  

User awareness and system monitoring play a critical role in prevention.

## 🛠️ Tools & Environment
- :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0} interactive lab environment  
- Simulated malware-related scenarios  
- Guided tasks focusing on identification and awareness  

---

## 🔍 Defensive & SOC Perspective
From a SOC viewpoint, malware detection involves:
- Monitoring suspicious process behavior  
- Analyzing alerts from endpoint protection tools  
- Reviewing logs for unusual file or network activity  
- Responding quickly to contain and isolate infected systems  

Early detection significantly reduces impact.

## ❓ Questions & Answers (Conceptual)

### Q1️⃣ What is malware?
**Answer:**  
Malware is malicious software designed to damage systems, steal information, or gain unauthorized access to resources.

---

### Q2️⃣ How do Trojans differ from other malware?
**Answer:**  
Trojans disguise themselves as legitimate software and rely on users to execute them, rather than spreading automatically.

---

### Q3️⃣ Why is ransomware considered especially dangerous?
**Answer:**  
Because it can render critical data inaccessible, disrupt operations, and cause significant financial and reputational damage.

---

### Q4️⃣ What are common signs of malware infection?
**Answer:**  
Unusual system behavior, slow performance, unexpected network traffic, unknown processes, and security alerts.

---

### Q5️⃣ How can organizations reduce malware risk?
**Answer:**  
By applying security patches, using endpoint protection, educating users, monitoring logs, and responding quickly to suspicious activity.

---

## 🧩 Skills Developed
- Malware awareness and threat recognition  
- Understanding of infection vectors  
- Defensive security thinking  
- SOC-aligned incident awareness
