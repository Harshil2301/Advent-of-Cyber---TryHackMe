# 🎄 Advent of Cyber 2025 — Day 03  
## 📊 Log Analysis & SIEM Fundamentals

Day 03 introduces **log analysis** and the role of **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)** systems in detecting, analyzing, and responding to security incidents.

This day is crucial for understanding how SOC teams gain visibility into system activity and identify potential threats using centralized logs.

---

## 🎯 Objective
- Understand what logs are and why they matter in cybersecurity  
- Learn how security events are generated from logs  
- Introduce the purpose and functionality of SIEM systems  
- Understand how SOC analysts use SIEM for threat detection  

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts Covered

### 🔹 What Are Logs?
Logs are records of events generated by:
- Operating systems  
- Applications  
- Network devices  
- Security tools  

They provide visibility into **what happened, when it happened, and where it happened**.

---

### 🔹 Security Events
A **security event** is a meaningful occurrence derived from logs, such as:
- Failed login attempts  
- Privilege escalation  
- Unusual network activity  

Events help analysts identify suspicious or malicious behavior.

---

### 🔹 SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)
A **SIEM** system collects logs from multiple sources, normalizes them, and correlates events to detect potential threats.

Core SIEM functions include:
- Centralized log collection  
- Event correlation  
- Alert generation  
- Incident investigation support

## 🛠️ Tools & Environment
- :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0} interactive lab environment  
- Simulated log data and security events  
- Guided SOC-style analysis tasks  

---

## 🔍 SOC Analyst Perspective
From a SOC standpoint, SIEM tools help analysts:
- Detect anomalies across large datasets  
- Prioritize alerts based on severity  
- Investigate incidents efficiently  
- Reduce response time through correlation  

Without SIEM, monitoring modern infrastructures at scale becomes impractical.

## ❓ Questions & Answers (Conceptual)

### Q1️⃣ What is a log in cybersecurity?
**Answer:**  
A log is a record of system, application, or network activity that provides information about events occurring within an environment.

---

### Q2️⃣ What is the difference between logs and security events?
**Answer:**  
Logs are raw records of activity, while security events are meaningful or suspicious occurrences identified from logs through analysis or correlation.

---

### Q3️⃣ What is a SIEM system?
**Answer:**  
A SIEM system is a security solution that centralizes log collection, correlates events, and generates alerts to help detect and respond to security incidents.

---

### Q4️⃣ Why is log correlation important?
**Answer:**  
Log correlation helps identify patterns across multiple systems that may indicate an attack, which might not be visible when logs are viewed individually.

---

### Q5️⃣ How does SIEM support SOC operations?
**Answer:**  
SIEM enables SOC teams to monitor environments continuously, prioritize alerts, investigate incidents, and respond to threats more efficiently.

---

## 🧩 Skills Developed
- Understanding of log-based monitoring  
- Familiarity with SIEM concepts and workflows  
- Analytical thinking for threat detection  
- SOC-aligned incident awareness  

---

## 📝 Reflection
This challenge highlighted how **logs form the backbone of security monitoring**. Learning how SIEM systems aggregate and correlate logs provided insight into how SOC teams detect threats early and manage incidents effectively in real-world environments.
