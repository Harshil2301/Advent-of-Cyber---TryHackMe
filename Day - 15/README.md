# 🎄 Advent of Cyber 2025 — Day 15  
## 🕵️ Web Attack Forensics & Incident Investigation

Day 15 focuses on **web attack forensics**, introducing how security teams investigate web-based attacks after they occur by analyzing logs, requests, and system evidence.

This challenge emphasizes a **post-incident analysis mindset**, which is critical for SOC analysts and incident responders.

---

## 🎯 Objective
- Understand what web attack forensics involves  
- Learn how web attacks leave traces in logs  
- Identify common forensic artifacts from web incidents  
- Develop investigation and incident analysis skills  

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts Covered

### 🔹 Web Attack Forensics
Web attack forensics is the process of analyzing evidence generated by web applications and servers to:
- Identify attack methods  
- Determine affected resources  
- Understand attacker behavior  
- Support incident response and remediation  

Forensics helps answer **what happened, how it happened, and what was impacted**.

---

### 🔹 Common Web Attack Artifacts
Web attacks often leave behind artifacts such as:
- HTTP request and response logs  
- Suspicious URL parameters  
- Abnormal request patterns  
- Error logs triggered by malicious input  

These artifacts provide insight into attack techniques like XSS, SQL injection, or brute-force attempts.

---

### 🔹 Importance of Logs in Forensics
Logs are a primary data source for web forensics, including:
- Access logs  
- Error logs  
- Application-specific logs  

Without proper logging, reconstructing an attack becomes extremely difficult.

---

### 🔹 Timeline Reconstruction
Incident investigation often involves building a **timeline**:
- Initial access  
- Exploitation attempts  
- Post-exploitation activity  

Timelines help understand attack progression and scope.

## 🛠️ Tools & Environment
- :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0} interactive lab environment  
- Simulated web server logs  
- Guided forensic analysis tasks  

---

## 🔍 SOC & Incident Response Perspective
From a SOC perspective, web forensics supports:
- Incident confirmation  
- Impact assessment  
- Root cause analysis  
- Evidence collection for remediation  

SOC teams often correlate web logs with network and authentication data for complete visibility.

## ❓ Questions & Answers (Conceptual)

### Q1️⃣ What is web attack forensics?
**Answer:**  
Web attack forensics is the process of analyzing web server and application data to investigate malicious activity and understand how an attack occurred.

---

### Q2️⃣ What types of logs are most useful in web forensics?
**Answer:**  
Web server access logs, error logs, and application-specific logs are critical for reconstructing web-based attacks.

---

### Q3️⃣ Why is timeline reconstruction important?
**Answer:**  
Timelines help investigators understand the sequence of events, identify attack stages, and determine the scope of impact.

---

### Q4️⃣ What indicators might suggest a web attack?
**Answer:**  
Unusual request patterns, suspicious parameters, repeated errors, unexpected HTTP methods, or spikes in traffic.

---

### Q5️⃣ How does web forensics support incident response?
**Answer:**  
It provides evidence needed to confirm incidents, identify affected systems, guide containment actions, and prevent future attacks.

---

## 🧩 Skills Developed
- Web log analysis  
- Incident investigation thinking  
- Forensic evidence interpretation  
- SOC-aligned response reasoning
