# 🎄 Advent of Cyber 2025 — Day 09  
## 🚨 Alert Triage & Incident Prioritization (SOC Fundamentals)

Day 09 focuses on **alert triage and incident prioritization**, a core responsibility of SOC analysts.  
Security tools often generate a large number of alerts, and not all of them indicate real threats.

This challenge highlights how SOC teams evaluate alerts, reduce noise, and prioritize incidents effectively.

---

## 🎯 Objective
- Understand what security alerts are  
- Learn why alert triage is necessary  
- Identify how SOC analysts prioritize incidents  
- Develop decision-making skills for incident response  

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts Covered

### 🔹 Security Alerts
Security alerts are notifications generated by security tools when suspicious activity is detected.

Alerts may originate from:
- SIEM systems  
- Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR) tools  
- Firewalls and IDS/IPS  
- Authentication and access logs  

Not all alerts represent real attacks.

---

### 🔹 Alert Fatigue
Alert fatigue occurs when analysts are overwhelmed by excessive alerts, many of which may be false positives.

Consequences include:
- Missed real incidents  
- Delayed response times  
- Reduced analyst efficiency  

Effective triage is essential to combat alert fatigue.

---

### 🔹 Alert Triage
Alert triage is the process of:
- Reviewing alerts  
- Determining their legitimacy  
- Assigning severity levels  
- Deciding whether escalation is required  

Triage helps SOC teams focus on **high-impact threats first**.

---

### 🔹 Incident Prioritization
Incidents are prioritized based on:
- Severity and impact  
- Affected systems or users  
- Likelihood of exploitation  
- Business criticality  

Prioritization ensures efficient use of security resources.

## 🛠️ Tools & Environment
- :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0} interactive lab environment  
- Simulated SOC alerts and incident scenarios  
- Guided exercises focused on decision-making  

---

## 🔍 SOC Analyst Perspective
From a SOC perspective, effective alert triage involves:
- Contextual analysis of alerts  
- Correlating multiple data sources  
- Reducing false positives  
- Escalating confirmed threats for response  

Good triage directly improves incident response quality.

## ❓ Questions & Answers (Conceptual)

### Q1️⃣ What is a security alert?
**Answer:**  
A security alert is a notification generated by security tools when potentially suspicious or malicious activity is detected.

---

### Q2️⃣ Why is alert triage important in a SOC?
**Answer:**  
Because SOC teams receive many alerts, triage helps identify which ones require immediate attention and which can be deprioritized or dismissed.

---

### Q3️⃣ What is alert fatigue?
**Answer:**  
Alert fatigue occurs when analysts are overwhelmed by excessive alerts, causing decreased efficiency and increased risk of missing real threats.

---

### Q4️⃣ How do SOC teams prioritize incidents?
**Answer:**  
By evaluating severity, potential impact, affected assets, and likelihood of exploitation to focus on the most critical threats.

---

### Q5️⃣ What happens after an alert is escalated?
**Answer:**  
Escalated alerts are investigated further, containment actions may be taken, and incident response procedures are initiated if necessary.

---

## 🧩 Skills Developed
- SOC decision-making and analytical thinking  
- Understanding of alert workflows  
- Incident prioritization awareness  
- Threat assessment fundamentals  

---

## 📝 Reflection
This challenge demonstrated that **effective cybersecurity is not about reacting to every alert**, but about making informed decisions quickly. Alert triage and prioritization are essential skills that allow SOC teams to focus on genuine threats and respond efficiently in real-world environments.
